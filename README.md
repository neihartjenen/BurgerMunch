# BurgerMunch
Burger Task Manager App
In this project, I will be creating an application that will devour burgers. This application will use MySQL, Express, Handlebars and a self-created ORM. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in Node and MySQL to be able to query and route data. As well as to show how you can use handlebars to generate HTML. The biggest take away I got from completing this was trying to stay organized with my file structure and making sure everything is linked properly. It was also very rewarding learning how to create a ORM and being able to configure a directory to connect Node to MySql.
